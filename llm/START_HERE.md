# SwiftLLM Start Here

## Use When

Read this before working in SwiftLLM. It gives the shortest route to the relevant docs and package targets.

## Quick Facts

- Repo type: Swift package plus XcodeGen iOS showcase app.
- Package name: `swift-llm`.
- Public products:
  - `SwiftLLM`
  - `SwiftLLMFoundationModels`
  - `SwiftLLMEvaluation`
- Primary language: Swift 6.2.
- Platforms: iOS 26, macOS 26, visionOS 26.
- Mission: reliability primitives for local-first Apple language model features.
- First incubation app: Chime In.
- Durable docs: `docs/`.
- Expendable notes: `scratch/`.

## Recommended Read Order

1. `../docs/README.md`
2. `capabilities/repo-map.md`
3. `capabilities/foundation-models-wrapper.md`
4. `capabilities/reliability-patterns.md`
5. `capabilities/chime-in-incubation.md` when work is driven by Chime In
6. One focused playbook based on the task

## Recommended Playbooks

- Build, test, or regenerate the showcase:
  `playbooks/build-and-verify.md`
- Add a core package primitive:
  `playbooks/add-generation-primitive.md`
- Change prompts, validation, or quality behavior:
  `playbooks/evaluate-prompt-change.md`
- Update the showcase or docs:
  `playbooks/refresh-showcase-and-docs.md`

## Files Likely Involved

- `Package.swift`
- `Sources/SwiftLLM/`
- `Sources/SwiftLLMFoundationModels/`
- `Sources/SwiftLLMEvaluation/`
- `Tests/SwiftLLMTests/`
- `Examples/LLMShowcase/project.yml`
- `docs/`
- `llm/`

## Source Of Truth

- Package structure and public targets: `Package.swift`.
- Long-term architecture and product direction: `docs/`.
- Agent routing: `llm/`.
- Scratch notes: `scratch/`, not source of truth.

## Escalate To Code When

- you know whether the change belongs in core, Foundation Models integration, evaluation, or the showcase
- you know whether a Chime In-driven idea is app-specific or package-general
- a doc or playbook points to a specific target or file

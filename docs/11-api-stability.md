# API Stability

## Current Stability Level

SwiftLLM follows semantic versioning from `1.0.0` onward. Public APIs are expected to remain source-compatible across patch and minor releases unless a security or platform compatibility issue leaves no practical alternative.

The package is still young. New functionality should prefer additive APIs, small value types, and explicit provider boundaries so later releases can grow without forcing adopters through broad migrations.

## Versioning Policy

- follow semantic versioning
- reserve source-breaking changes for major versions
- keep deprecations around for at least one minor release when practical
- document migration steps for removed or renamed APIs

## Public API Categories

### Stable Candidates

These APIs are treated as stable public surface in `1.0.0`:

- provider metadata
- prompt contracts
- token budget and token counter
- simple chunking
- grounding validation
- fallback reasons
- evaluation result records
- provider-neutral request, response, message, tool, schema, and stream-event value types

They are small value types and already have tests.

### Incubating APIs

These are useful but should remain easy to revise:

- Foundation Models generation wrappers
- Foundation Models native tool wrappers
- Foundation Models runtime readiness models for PCC, quota, reasoning, and dynamic context hints
- OpenAI and Anthropic adapters
- endpoint registry and routing plans
- provider capabilities and router fallback policy
- router and high-level LLM pipeline
- redacted run receipts
- context compiler
- structured generation pipeline
- workflow orchestration primitives (`LLMWorkflow`, `LLMStep`, `LLMWorkflowResult`, and workflow diagnostics)
- transcript chunking
- local RAG pipeline
- context packing strategies
- structured output assertions
- debug bundle format

They are public and tested, but their convenience layers may grow through additive APIs as real apps exercise them.

### Experimental Future APIs

These should not be promised publicly until implemented and tested:

- provider retry/backoff policy hooks
- SQLite/GRDB retrieval adapters
- embedding-backed retrieval
- automatic repair loops
- custom Foundation Models adapter management

## Naming Rules

- Prefer behavior names over implementation trend names.
- Keep app-specific language out of public API names.
- Keep provider-specific names inside provider-specific targets.
- Do not use "magic", "agent", or "chain" terminology unless the API genuinely models that concept.
- Prefer "workflow" and "step" for deterministic app-composed orchestration. Reserve "agent" for a
  future API only if the package actually owns autonomous planning, tool choice, and execution loops.

## Deprecation Rules

When replacing a public API:

1. Add the new API.
2. Add tests for the new behavior.
3. Mark the old API deprecated when the migration is clear.
4. Document migration notes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
5. Remove the old API only at an allowed breaking-change boundary.

Direct replacement without deprecation should be reserved for major versions or unreleased branch-only APIs.

## Compatibility Checks

Before tagging a public release:

- run `./scripts/validate.sh`
- build DocC documentation
- scan `Sources/` for public symbols added without docs or tests
- scan docs for private Chime In details
- verify generated Xcode projects and build artifacts are not staged

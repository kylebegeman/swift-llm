If you are an agent or want the cheapest route to the right files, use [`../llm/START_HERE.md`](../llm/START_HERE.md).

## Durable vs. Scratch

Durable docs live here. They should be kept accurate and reviewed when APIs or architecture decisions change.

Temporary notes live in [`../scratch/`](../scratch/). Scratch files are expendable and should not be treated as source of truth.
